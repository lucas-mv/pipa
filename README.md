Pipa is a simple [go](https://golang.org/) web application to fetch the most relevant twitter trending topics based on your address.

As of right now you can access it [here](https://pipa-tts.herokuapp.com/), you'll need to put your address on the query string (really simple stuff, as if you were to look up your house on Google or Bing maps).

## Example

If you access https://pipa-tts.herokuapp.com/?address=rua%20roquete%20mendon%C3%A7a,%2064,%20belo%20horizonte the result will be pretty similar to this:

## Build

`git clone` the project and run `go build` on the cloned folder.

## Running

You can run it with the `go run` command or run the executable file generated by the `go build` command.

The application serves on a random avaliable port on the host machine. You'll need to provide the `bing_api_key` and `twitter_basic_key` environment variables to run it properly.

### twitter_basic_key
A [Twitter Developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started) [Basic Auth Base64 key](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/basic-auth).

### bing_api_key 
[Bing Maps API key](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/).


## Why pipa?

Pipa is the name of a dog that I really like that lives in my mom's house.
